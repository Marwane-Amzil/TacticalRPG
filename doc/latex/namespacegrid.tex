\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
The \mbox{\hyperlink{_constants_8hpp_source}{Constants.\+hpp}} file has the role of stocking different Constants. The Tactical-\/\+RPG Project is a game developement Project. This project involves having a lot of fixed values. Throughout coding having One place where all those different constants are stocked seems to be the best solution for us. Using different namespaces gives the possibility to seperate the diffenrent variable by where they are needed, without having to add new variable names where they have the same function. When wantting to use this file you use \+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item using namespace constants\+\_\+class\+Name; in the header file. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
