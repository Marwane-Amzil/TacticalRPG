Creating a game from 0 in C++. This project is educative. Wich means that the only goal is to learn the maximum of this project.

We are 3 students in second year working on the project. 

We are using C++ language because it is a low level language and if mastered it becomes easier to adapt to other languages, because of the performances that comes out of the language and because of the community wich is enormous. 

The learnings that we want to get out of this project are :
-   Devellopement
-   Project management
-   network 
-   Database
-   TeamWork

We also use SFML to create the graphic side of the game.
